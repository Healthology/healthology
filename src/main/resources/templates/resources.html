                                    <li>Staying positive because a positive attitude can go a long way. Take a second to
                                        look at one good thing that happened in your day, even if it was something

                                        healthcare provider, or other professionals. Having this social support is
                                        essential in healing from mental illness, and you will be able to ask them for
                                        referrals or recommendations for trusted mental health practitioners. Search for
                                        mental health resources in your area.<br><br>

                                        may be led by a mental health professional.
